 * *** Introduction ***
 *
 *      This plugin adds bust support to RPG Maker MV's message system. You can
 * control all bust functions from either the Show Text event command itself or
 * through Script Calls. This plugin supports one bust on the Message Window
 * and ten other busts on the screen behind it.
 * 
 *      Busts can move, fade in and out, change opacity, slide in and out,
 * mirror themselves, change scale, and have tones applied to them. While some
 * of these options can be done through Show Picture event commands, having too
 * many pictures on the screen can cause performance dips. By making busts
 * separate sprites from pictures, there are less issues, too.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * *** Quick Understanding on How Busts Work ***
 * 
 *      Screen busts are located behind pictures. The message bust is located
 * in front of the Message Window but behind the Message Window's text. Since
 * the Message Window is located above pictures, that means the message bust is
 * located above them, too.
 * 
 *      Busts are temporal. They will NOT persist through a scene change. This
 * means if you go to a different map or enter a menu, the busts will disappear
 * from the screen. That also means that saving while a bust is on the screen
 * will not have them persist either as you would have to change scene to save.
 * If you want to make something persist, I would recommend using pictures.
 *
 *
 *
 * *** Plugin Parameters ***
 *
 * Bust Defaults
 * 
 *      You can set where each bust is located on the screen and the settings
 * that apply to them. You can make some smaller, some larger, some located on
 * a higher Y position, and how they're anchored at the base. You don't have
 * to adjust any of these settings since they'll work fine as they will scale
 * to your game's resolution. Tweak them only if you want to.
 *
 * Bust Settings
 *
 *      This is a section of mostly duration settings used by the various text
 * codes made and used by this plugin. This is to let you set a default value
 * if you ever decide to just cut the duration aspect out of the text codes to
 * save time or to set up consistency.
 *
 * Auto Clear
 *
 *      Other than the message bust, screen busts don't reset by themselves
 * normally. You can turn this on by setting it to true and the busts will then
 * disappear and automatically reset themselves each time after an event is
 * over to save you the work of having to manually clear everything. Switching
 * between pages in an Autorun event will also trigger Auto Clear.
 *
 *      Even if this option is on, you will need to manually clear busts for 
 * busts that were made with parallel events or battle troop events. Don't
 * worry, the code for that is simple if you just want to run a Script Call:
 *
 * [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].forEach(function(i) {
 *   $bust(i).clear();
 * });
 *
 *
 *
 * Expression List
 * 
 *      Busts are capable of supporting multiple expressions. By default, busts
 * will only have one expression: "Normal". To add more expressions to a single
 * bust sheet, you will have to name your file a certain way.
 * 
 *      filename[BUST][Exp4x2].png
 * 
 * Replace 4x2 with the number of cells going horizontal by vertical. 4x2 means
 * there are 4 cells going horizontal and 2 cells going vertical. The cells can
 * be used as expressions through the \bustExpression[id, expression] text code
 * where 'expression' can be replaced by a number to represent the index (with
 * zero as the starting index) or replaced by a keyword.
 *
 *      Keywords can be inserted into the plugin parameter's Expression List,
 * which automatically converts into an index. If "Angry" is the first string
 * in the Expression List plugin parameter, using \bustExpression[0, Angry]
 * will be the same as using \bustExpression[0, 1] as a text code. This means
 * that the string entries correspond to their exact order in the Expression
 * List plugin parameter so organize your bust cells to fit that usage.
 *
 * 
 *
 * Move Type
 * 
 *      This plugin supports move easings for busts. Move easings let a bust
 * move in a non-linear fashion to make it look less stiff. You can still pick
 * linear if you want, but this lets you set the default move type for each
 * bust each time its settings are reset. Look deeper into the help section to
 * what kind of easings there are.
 *
 * 
 *
 * *** How to Use Bust Controls ***
 *
 * ++++++++++++++++++
 * First Things First
 * ++++++++++++++++++
 * 
 * There's two different ways of controlling busts, 1) through the Show Text,
 * event command and 2) script calls. Sane people will most likely be
 * controlling the busts through the Show Text event, but for the people who
 * want absolute control over the bust sprites, you can use the script calls.
 *
 * +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 * Where to Place Your Bust Images
 * +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 * 
 * There's two places you can put your bust images: the img/faces/ or
 * img/pictures/ folders. If you place them in img/faces/, you are able to
 * change their bitmaps through both Show Text's text codes and Script Calls.
 * If you place them in img/pictures/, then you can only change their bitmaps
 * through Script Calls. Outside of changing the images, you can control them
 * through both Show Text text codes and Script Calls.
 *
 * +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 * Bust Text Codes Are Instant Unless Modified
 * +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 * 
 * I just want to put this out there that bust text codes listed below are
 * instant unless you modify them a certain way. That certain way is to add
 * 'Msg' in between \bust and the keyword depicting the action. For example,
 *
 *    \bustExpression[0, Angry]
 * 
 *    becomes
 *
 *    \bustMsgExpression[0, Angry]
 *
 * When you use 'Msg' in the text code, it will delay the instant nature of the
 * text code to wait until the message window reaches that placement of where
 * the 'Msg' version of the text code is. Let's take a look at this example:
 *
 *    Hello! \!
 *    \bustMsgExpression[0, Angry]Now I'm angry!
 *    \bust[0]\bustSlideIn[0]
 *
 * What will happen first is that the bust gets assigned to bust 0, the Message
 * Window bust. The bust will slide in as per the instructions of the text code
 * \bust[0]\bustSlideIn[0]. The text displayed will be 'Hello!' followed by a
 * wait for input using the \! text code. The bust then changes to the angry
 * expression through \bustMsgExpression[0, Angry] and displays the text
 * 'Now I'm angry!' as the final action. That's the sequence of orders for the
 * timings in the listed message.
 *
 * +++++++++++++++++
 * Displaying a Bust
 * +++++++++++++++++
 * 
 * Does exactly what it means, display a bust. There are 11 busts that can be
 * controlled. 0 is the Message Window's bust graphic. 1 through 10 are the
 * busts that are shown on the screen behind the Message Window.
 * 
 * Insert [BUST] into the filenames of face graphics and they will be setup
 * automatically to change as the bust graphic. Harold.png will become
 * Harold[BUST].png. This makes it unnecessary for you to use \bust[0] every
 * time you want to set a bust to the message window itself. This only works
 * for images in the img/faces/ folder.
 * 
 * Text Code:
 *      \bust[id]
 *      - Requirement: Select a face graphic.
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to implant the face graphic on.
 *        - 0 if you want to use the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to use the screen busts.
 *      - Examples:
 *        - \bust[0]
 *        - \bust[1]
 *
 * Script Call:
 *      $bust(id).loadBitmap('face', 'filename')
 *      $bust(id).loadBitmap('picture', 'filename')
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to implant the face graphic on.
 *        - 0 if you want to use the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to use the screen busts.
 *      - Decide if you're going to load from img/faces/ or img/pictures/
 *      - Replace 'filename' with the exact case sensitive filename of the file
 *      while keeping the quotes.
 *      - Examples:
 *        - $bust(0).loadBitmap('face', 'Harold[BUST]')
 *        - $bust(1).loadBitmap('picture', 'Therese[BUST]')
 * 
 *
 *
 * +++++
 * Clear
 * +++++
 *
 * Clearing a bust removes it from view and resets it to the default settings
 * so that the next time it's used, it will be a fresh slate. This is done
 * automatically for message busts after the Message Window closes. A plugin
 * parameter setting can be turned on to make all busts clear after an event
 * finishes running.
 * 
 * Text Codes:
 *      \bustClear[id, duration]
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - (Optional) Replace duration with how long it takes to clear.
 *        - If no duration is used, then use the value in the plugin parameters
 *      - Examples:
 *        - \bustClear[0]
 *        - \bustClear[2, 20]
 *
 * Script Call:
 *      $bust(id).clear(duration)
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - (Optional) Replace duration with how long it takes to clear.
 *        - If no duration is used, then use the value in the plugin parameters
 *      - Examples:
 *        - $bust(0).clear()
 *        - $bust(2).clear(20)
 * 
 *
 *
 * +++++++++++
 * Expressions
 * +++++++++++
 *
 * If you have set up a bust to use expressions, you can use this text code to
 * change the expression of the bust. Please refer to the "Expression List"
 * part of the help section up above to learn how to set up busts to make an
 * expression sheet.
 * 
 * Text Codes:
 *      \bustExp[id, expression]
 *      \bustExpression[id, expression]
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - Replace expression with either a number index or the string that is
 *        associated with that expression to display the wanted expression.
 *      - Examples:
 *        - \bustExp[0, 1]
 *        - \bustExpression[2, Angry]
 *
 * Script Call:
 *      $bust(id).setExpression(expression)
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - Replace expression with either a number index or the string that is
 *        associated with that expression to display the wanted expression.
 *      - Examples:
 *        - $bust(0).setExpression(1)
 *        - $bust(2).setExpression('Angry')
 * 
 *
 *
 * +++++++++++++++++
 * Battle Animations
 * +++++++++++++++++
 *
 * You can play battle animations on the busts to depict actions, emotions,
 * whatever you want them to do. These will play the battle animation only once
 * before closing out.
 * 
 * Text Codes:
 *      \bustAni[id, ani, mirror, delay]
 *      \bustAnimation[id, ani, mirror, delay]
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - Replace ani with the ID of the battle animation
 *        - Alternatively, you can type out the battle animation's name, too.
 *      - (Optional) Replace mirror with true/face to mirror the animation.
 *      - (Optional) Replace delay with the frames to wait before playing.
 *      - Examples:
 *        - \bustAni[0, 5]
 *        - \bustAnimation[2, Healing One 2, true, 20]
 *
 * Script Call:
 *      $bust(id).startAnimation(ani, mirror, delay)
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - Replace ani with the ID of the battle animation
 *        - Alternatively, you can type out the battle animation's name, too.
 *          If you do, make it into a string for the Script Call.
 *      - (Optional) Replace mirror with true/face to mirror the animation.
 *      - (Optional) Replace delay with the frames to wait before playing.
 *      - Examples:
 *        - $bust(0).startAnimation(5)
 *        - $bust(2).startAnimation('Healing One 2', true, 20)
 *
 *
 *
 * +++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 * Repeating Battle Animations
 * +++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 * 
 * Play battle animations repeatedly instead of one time. Otherwise, this is
 * the same as playing regular battle animations. Repeating animations will
 * stop automatically for message busts when the window closes. For screen
 * busts, they will vanish once the event terminates.
 * 
 * Text Codes:
 *      \bustRepAni[id, ani, mirror, delay]
 *      \bustRepeatAnimation[id, ani, mirror, delay]
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - Replace ani with the ID of the battle animation
 *        - Alternatively, you can type out the battle animation's name, too.
 *      - (Optional) Replace mirror with true/face to mirror the animation.
 *      - (Optional) Replace delay with the frames to wait before playing.
 *      - Examples:
 *        - \bustRepAni[0, 5]
 *        - \bustRepeatingAnimation[2, Healing One 2, true, 20]
 *
 * Script Call:
 *      $bust(id).setupRepeatingAnimation(ani, mirror, delay)
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - Replace ani with the ID of the battle animation
 *        - Alternatively, you can type out the battle animation's name, too.
 *          If you do, make it into a string for the Script Call.
 *      - (Optional) Replace mirror with true/face to mirror the animation.
 *      - (Optional) Replace delay with the frames to wait before playing.
 *      - Examples:
 *        - $bust(0).setupRepeatingAnimation(5)
 *        - $bust(2).setupRepeatingAnimation('Healing One 2', true, 20)
 *
 *
 *
 * ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 * Clear Repeating Battle Animation
 * ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 * 
 * Put an end to a repeating battle animation because otherwise that is going
 * to go on forever until the currently running event fully terminates.
 *
 * Text Codes:
 *      \bustClearAni[id]
 *      \bustClearAnimation[id]
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - Examples:
 *        - \bustClearAni[0]
 *        - \bustClearAnimation[3]
 * 
 * Script Call:
 *      $bust(id).clearRepeatingAnimation();
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - Examples:
 *        - $bust(0).clearRepeatingAnimation();
 *        - $bust(3).clearRepeatingAnimation();
 *

 * Move To
 * +++++++
 * 
 * Allows bust sprites to move to specific x and y coordinates. This does not
 * work for message busts as they're locked to the Message Window.

 *        - $bust(5).moveTo(100, 360, 60)
 *
 *
 *
 * +++++++
 * Move By
 * +++++++
 * 
 * Allows bust sprites to move relative to their current position. This does
 * not work for message busts as they're locked to the Message Window.

 *      - Replace x with how far left(-) or right(+) to move by.
 *      - Replace y with how far up(-) or down(+) to move by.
 *      - (Optional) Replace duration with how long it takes to move there.
 *        - If no duration is used, then use the value in the plugin parameters
 *      - Examples:
 *        - \bustMoveBy[1, -100, +0]
 *        - \bustMoveBy[5, +200, -50, 60]
 *
 * Script Call:
 *      $bust(id).moveBy(+x, +y, duration)
 *      $bust(id).moveBy(-x, -y, duration)
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - Replace x with how far left(-) or right(+) to move by.
 *      - Replace y with how far up(-) or down(+) to move by.
 *      - (Optional) Replace duration with how long it takes to move there.
 *        - If no duration is used, then use the value in the plugin parameters
 *      - Examples:
 *        - $bust(1).moveBy(-100, +0)
 *        - $bust(5).moveBy(+200, -50, 60)
 *
 *
 *
 * +++++++++
 * Move Home
 * +++++++++
 * 
 * Returns a bust sprite back to the home position. For those moments you're
 * too confused, lazy, or both to figure out how to bring a bust sprite back to
 * the original coordinates it was in. This does not work for message busts as
 * they're locked to the Message Window.
 *
 * Text Code:
 *      \bustMoveHome[id, duration]

 * If you don't want to fully change a bust's opacity to either 0 or 255, set
 * it to whatever opacity level you want instead.
 *
 * Text Code:
 *      \bustOpacityTo[id, opacity, duration]
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - Replace opacity with a number between 0 and 255 for how opaque it is.
 *      - (Optional) Replace duration with how long it takes to fade in or out.
 *        - If no duration is used, then use the value in the plugin parameters
 *      - Examples:
 *        - \bustOpacityTo[0, 128]
 *        - \bustOpacityTo[7, 64]
 *
 * Script Call:
 *      $bust(id).opacityTo(opacity, duration)

 * 
 * This changes the opacity level of a bust relative to its current opacity
 * instead of needing to put in an exact value.
 *
 * Text Code:
 *      \bustOpacityBy[id, +opacity, duration]
 *      \bustOpacityBy[id, -opacity, duration]
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.

 * +++++++++++++++++++
 * Slide In, Slide Out
 * +++++++++++++++++++
 * 
 * Sliding In and Sliding Out is a small move and fade in/out combo that is
 * based around the bust's home position. This makes busts look like they're
 * fading into the scene or fading out of them.
 *
 * Text Code:
 *      \bustSlideIn[id, duration]
 *      \bustSlideInFromLeft[id, duration]
 *      \bustSlideInFromRight[id, duration]
 *      \bustSlideOut[id, duration]
 *      \bustSlideOutToLeft[id, duration]
 *      \bustSlideOutToRight[id, duration]
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - Use the FromLeft, FromRight, ToLeft, ToRight versions to control the
 *        direction the busts are going or leave it up to the plugin.
 *      - (Optional) Replace duration with how long it takes to slide in/out.
 *        - If no duration is used, then use the value in the plugin parameters
 *      - Examples:
 *        - \bustSlideIn[0]
 *        - \bustSlideOut[9, 20]
 *
 * Script Call:
 *      $bust(id).slideIn(duration)
 *      $bust(id).slideInFromLeft(duration)
 *      $bust(id).slideInFromRight(duration)
 *      $bust(id).slideOut(duration)
 *      $bust(id).slideOutToLeft(duration)
 *      $bust(id).slideOutToRight(duration)
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - Use the FromLeft, FromRight, ToLeft, ToRight versions to control the
 *        direction the busts are going or leave it up to the plugin.
 *      - (Optional) Replace duration with how long it takes to slide in/out.
 *        - If no duration is used, then use the value in the plugin parameters
 *      - Examples:
 *        - $bust(0).slideIn()
 *        - $bust(9).slideOut(20)
 *
 *
 *
 * ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 * Mirror, Unmirror, MirrorToggle
 * ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 * 
 * Lets you set the bust sprite to mirror, unmirror, or toggle the mirror
 * setting it currently has.
 *
 * Text Code:
 *      \bustMirror[id]
 *      \bustUnmirror[id]
 *      \bustMirrorToggle[id]
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - Examples:
 *        - \bustMirror[0]
 *        - \bustUnmirror[1]
 *        - \bustMirrorToggle[1]
 *
 * Script Call:
 *      $bust(id).mirror()
 *      $bust(id).unmirror()
 *      $bust(id).mirrorToggle()
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - Examples:
 *        - $bust(0).slideIn()
 *        - $bust(9).slideOut(100, 20)
 *
 *
 *
 * ++++++++
 * Scale To
 * ++++++++
 * 
 * This lets you change the scale of the bust sprite to an exact amount. Now, I
 * know that sprites with a negative value for scale flip over, but these text
 * codes and script calls will disable that. If you want to mirror something,
 * use the mirror text codes for it.
 *
 * Text Code:
 *      \bustScaleTo[id, scale, duration]
 *      \bustScaleToX[id, scale, duration]
 *      \bustScaleToY[id, scale, duration]
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - Replace scale with a number value on how to scale it.
 *        - 0.5 is 50%. 1.0 is 100%. 1.5 is 150%.
 *      - (Optional) Replace duration with how long it takes to scale.
 *        - If no duration is used, then use the value in the plugin parameters
 *      - Use the X and Y variations if you want to adjust those specifically
 *      - Examples:
 *        - \bustScaleTo[0, 1.0]
 *        - \bustScaleToX[2, 0.5, 20]
 *        - \bustScaleToY[4, 2.5, 60]
 *
 * Script Call:
 *      $bust(id).scaleTo(scale, duration)
 *      $bust(id).scaleToX(scale, duration)
 *      $bust(id).scaleToY(scale, duration)
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - Replace scale with a number value on how to scale it.
 *        - 0.5 is 50%. 1.0 is 100%. 1.5 is 150%.

 *      - Examples:
 *        - $bust(0).scaleTo(1.0)
 *        - $bust(2).scaleToX(0.5, 20)
 *        - $bust(4).scaleToX(2.5, 60)
 *
 *
 *
 * ++++++++
 * Scale By
 * ++++++++
 * 
 * This lets you change the scale of the bust sprite relative to its current
 * scale value. This will work with an absolute value of the current scale to
 * remove any confusion about how mirrored scaling works, so just treat a bust
 * that is mirrored the same way you'd treat a bust that's not mirrored.
 *
 * Text Code:
 *      \bustScaleBy[id, +scale, duration]
 *      \bustScaleByX[id, -scale, duration]
 *      \bustScaleByY[id, +scale, duration]
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - Replace scale with a number value on how to scale it.
 *        - 0.5 is 50%. 1.0 is 100%. 1.5 is 150%.
 *      - (Optional) Replace duration with how long it takes to scale.
 *        - If no duration is used, then use the value in the plugin parameters
 *      - Use the X and Y variations if you want to adjust those specifically
 *      - Examples:
 *        - \bustScaleBy[0, -1.0]
 *        - \bustScaleByX[2, +0.5, 20]
 *        - \bustScaleByY[4, -2.5, 60]
 *
 * Script Call:
 *      $bust(id).scaleBy(+scale, duration)
 *      $bust(id).scaleByX(-scale, duration)
 *      $bust(id).scaleByY(+scale, duration)
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - Replace scale with a number value on how to scale it.
 *        - 0.5 is 50%. 1.0 is 100%. 1.5 is 150%.
 *      - (Optional) Replace duration with how long it takes to scale.
 *        - If no duration is used, then use the value in the plugin parameters
 *      - Use the X and Y variations if you want to adjust those specifically
 *      - Examples:
 *        - $bust(0).scaleBy(-1.0)
 *        - $bust(2).scaleToX(+0.5, 20)
 *        - $bust(4).scaleToX(-2.5, 60)
 *
 *
 *
 * ++++
 * Tone
 * ++++
 * 
 * Give busts a tone! Tones will tint the colors on a bust. The bust will then
 * change its tint towards that tone over time.
 *
 * Text Code:
 *      \bustTone[id, red, green, blue, gray, duration]
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - Replace red with a number between -255 and 255.
 *      - Replace green with a number between -255 and 255.
 *      - Replace blue with a number between -255 and 255.
 *      - Replace gray with a number between 0 and 255.
 *      - (Optional) Replace duration with how long it takes to change tone.
 *        - If no duration is used, then use the value in the plugin parameters
 *      - Examples:
 *        - \bustTone[0, -68, -68, 0, 68]
 *        - \bustTone[5, -68, -68, -68, 0, 60]
 *
 * Script Call:
 *      $bust(id).setTone(red, green, blue, gray, duration)
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - Replace red with a number between -255 and 255.
 *      - Replace green with a number between -255 and 255.
 *      - Replace blue with a number between -255 and 255.
 *      - Replace gray with a number between 0 and 255.
 *      - (Optional) Replace duration with how long it takes to change tone.
 *        - If no duration is used, then use the value in the plugin parameters
 *      - Examples:
 *        - $bust(0).setTone(-68, -68, 0, 68)
 *        - $bust(5).setTone(-68, -68, -68, 0, 60)
 *
 *
 *
 * ++++++++++
 * Dim, Light
 * ++++++++++
 * 
 * Dim and Light are preset tones that are primarily used for tinting busts.
 * Usually visual novels will dim busts that aren't talking and light the busts
 * that are. This is to speed up the process so that you don't have to type out
 * a tone code every time. You can set the dim and light values in the plugin
 * parameters. They'll also use the duration for tones if no duration is used
 * to specify that specific dim or light tone change.
 *
 * Text Code:
 *      \bustDim[id, duration]
 *      \bustLight[id, duration]
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - (Optional) Replace duration with how long it takes to change tone.
 *        - If no duration is used, then use the value in the plugin parameters
 *      - Examples:
 *        - \bustDim[0]
 *        - \bustLight[5, 60]
 *
 * Script Call:
 *      $bust(id).dim(duration)
 *      $bust(id).light(duration)
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - (Optional) Replace duration with how long it takes to change tone.
 *        - If no duration is used, then use the value in the plugin parameters
 *      - Examples:
 *        - $bust(0).dim()
 *        - $bust(5).light(60)
 *
 *
 *
 * *** Mass Bust Script Calls ***
 *
 * To have multiple busts do a bunch of things at once, you can use this piece
 * of code in a script to accomplish it with whatever script call listed above.
 *
 *
 *
 * [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].forEach(function(i) {
 *   $bust(i).slideIn(20);
 *   $bust(i).moveType('OutBounce');
 *   $bust(i).scaleTo(1.25, 20);
 * });
 *
 * 
 *
 * Replace the numbers in the array with the bust ID's that you want it to
 * affect and whatever script calls in the middle after the $bust(i). Do not
 * replace the i because that tells the code which bust to affect.
 * 
 * Any number that's not listed in that array won't have the bust associated
 * with it performing any of the listed actions in the middle.
 *

 *      This plugin adds bust support to RPG Maker MV's message system. You can
 * control all bust functions from either the Show Text event command itself or
 * through Script Calls. This plugin supports one bust on the Message Window
 * and ten other busts on the screen behind it.
 * 
 *      Busts can move, fade in and out, change opacity, slide in and out,
 * mirror themselves, change scale, and have tones applied to them. While some
 * of these options can be done through Show Picture event commands, having too
 * many pictures on the screen can cause performance dips. By making busts
 * separate sprites from pictures, there are less issues, too.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * *** Quick Understanding on How Busts Work ***
 * 
 *      Screen busts are located behind pictures. The message bust is located
 * in front of the Message Window but behind the Message Window's text. Since
 * the Message Window is located above pictures, that means the message bust is
 * located above them, too.
 * 
 *      Busts are temporal. They will NOT persist through a scene change. This
 * means if you go to a different map or enter a menu, the busts will disappear
 * from the screen. That also means that saving while a bust is on the screen
 * will not have them persist either as you would have to change scene to save.
 * If you want to make something persist, I would recommend using pictures.
 *
 *
 *
 * *** Plugin Parameters ***
 *
 * Bust Defaults
 * 
 *      You can set where each bust is located on the screen and the settings
 * that apply to them. You can make some smaller, some larger, some located on
 * a higher Y position, and how they're anchored at the base. You don't have
 * to adjust any of these settings since they'll work fine as they will scale
 * to your game's resolution. Tweak them only if you want to.
 *
 * Bust Settings
 *
 *      This is a section of mostly duration settings used by the various text
 * codes made and used by this plugin. This is to let you set a default value
 * if you ever decide to just cut the duration aspect out of the text codes to
 * save time or to set up consistency.
 *
 * Auto Clear
 *
 *      Other than the message bust, screen busts don't reset by themselves
 * normally. You can turn this on by setting it to true and the busts will then
 * disappear and automatically reset themselves each time after an event is
 * over to save you the work of having to manually clear everything. Switching
 * between pages in an Autorun event will also trigger Auto Clear.
 *
 *      Even if this option is on, you will need to manually clear busts for 
 * busts that were made with parallel events or battle troop events. Don't
 * worry, the code for that is simple if you just want to run a Script Call:
 *
 * [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].forEach(function(i) {
 *   $bust(i).clear();
 * });
 *
 *
 *
 * Expression List
 * 
 *      Busts are capable of supporting multiple expressions. By default, busts
 * will only have one expression: "Normal". To add more expressions to a single
 * bust sheet, you will have to name your file a certain way.
 * 
 *      filename[BUST][Exp4x2].png
 * 
 * Replace 4x2 with the number of cells going horizontal by vertical. 4x2 means
 * there are 4 cells going horizontal and 2 cells going vertical. The cells can
 * be used as expressions through the \bustExpression[id, expression] text code
 * where 'expression' can be replaced by a number to represent the index (with
 * zero as the starting index) or replaced by a keyword.
 *
 *      Keywords can be inserted into the plugin parameter's Expression List,
 * which automatically converts into an index. If "Angry" is the first string
 * in the Expression List plugin parameter, using \bustExpression[0, Angry]
 * will be the same as using \bustExpression[0, 1] as a text code. This means
 * that the string entries correspond to their exact order in the Expression
 * List plugin parameter so organize your bust cells to fit that usage.
 *
 * 
 *
 * Move Type
 * 
 *      This plugin supports move easings for busts. Move easings let a bust
 * move in a non-linear fashion to make it look less stiff. You can still pick
 * linear if you want, but this lets you set the default move type for each
 * bust each time its settings are reset. Look deeper into the help section to
 * what kind of easings there are.
 *
 * 
 *
 * *** How to Use Bust Controls ***
 *
 * ++++++++++++++++++
 * First Things First
 * ++++++++++++++++++
 * 
 * There's two different ways of controlling busts, 1) through the Show Text,
 * event command and 2) script calls. Sane people will most likely be
 * controlling the busts through the Show Text event, but for the people who
 * want absolute control over the bust sprites, you can use the script calls.
 *
 * +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 * Where to Place Your Bust Images
 * +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 * 
 * There's two places you can put your bust images: the img/faces/ or
 * img/pictures/ folders. If you place them in img/faces/, you are able to
 * change their bitmaps through both Show Text's text codes and Script Calls.
 * If you place them in img/pictures/, then you can only change their bitmaps
 * through Script Calls. Outside of changing the images, you can control them
 * through both Show Text text codes and Script Calls.
 *
 * +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 * Bust Text Codes Are Instant Unless Modified
 * +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 * 
 * I just want to put this out there that bust text codes listed below are
 * instant unless you modify them a certain way. That certain way is to add
 * 'Msg' in between \bust and the keyword depicting the action. For example,
 *
 *    \bustExpression[0, Angry]
 * 
 *    becomes
 *
 *    \bustMsgExpression[0, Angry]
 *
 * When you use 'Msg' in the text code, it will delay the instant nature of the
 * text code to wait until the message window reaches that placement of where
 * the 'Msg' version of the text code is. Let's take a look at this example:
 *
 *    Hello! \!
 *    \bustMsgExpression[0, Angry]Now I'm angry!
 *    \bust[0]\bustSlideIn[0]
 *
 * What will happen first is that the bust gets assigned to bust 0, the Message
 * Window bust. The bust will slide in as per the instructions of the text code
 * \bust[0]\bustSlideIn[0]. The text displayed will be 'Hello!' followed by a
 * wait for input using the \! text code. The bust then changes to the angry
 * expression through \bustMsgExpression[0, Angry] and displays the text
 * 'Now I'm angry!' as the final action. That's the sequence of orders for the
 * timings in the listed message.
 *
 * +++++++++++++++++
 * Displaying a Bust
 * +++++++++++++++++
 * 
 * Does exactly what it means, display a bust. There are 11 busts that can be
 * controlled. 0 is the Message Window's bust graphic. 1 through 10 are the
 * busts that are shown on the screen behind the Message Window.
 * 
 * Insert [BUST] into the filenames of face graphics and they will be setup
 * automatically to change as the bust graphic. Harold.png will become
 * Harold[BUST].png. This makes it unnecessary for you to use \bust[0] every
 * time you want to set a bust to the message window itself. This only works
 * for images in the img/faces/ folder.
 * 
 * Text Code:
 *      \bust[id]
 *      - Requirement: Select a face graphic.
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to implant the face graphic on.
 *        - 0 if you want to use the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to use the screen busts.
 *      - Examples:
 *        - \bust[0]
 *        - \bust[1]
 *
 * Script Call:
 *      $bust(id).loadBitmap('face', 'filename')
 *      $bust(id).loadBitmap('picture', 'filename')
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to implant the face graphic on.
 *        - 0 if you want to use the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to use the screen busts.
 *      - Decide if you're going to load from img/faces/ or img/pictures/
 *      - Replace 'filename' with the exact case sensitive filename of the file
 *      while keeping the quotes.
 *      - Examples:
 *        - $bust(0).loadBitmap('face', 'Harold[BUST]')
 *        - $bust(1).loadBitmap('picture', 'Therese[BUST]')
 * 
 *
 *
 * +++++
 * Clear
 * +++++
 *
 * Clearing a bust removes it from view and resets it to the default settings
 * so that the next time it's used, it will be a fresh slate. This is done
 * automatically for message busts after the Message Window closes. A plugin
 * parameter setting can be turned on to make all busts clear after an event
 * finishes running.
 * 
 * Text Codes:
 *      \bustClear[id, duration]
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - (Optional) Replace duration with how long it takes to clear.
 *        - If no duration is used, then use the value in the plugin parameters
 *      - Examples:
 *        - \bustClear[0]
 *        - \bustClear[2, 20]
 *
 * Script Call:
 *      $bust(id).clear(duration)
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - (Optional) Replace duration with how long it takes to clear.
 *        - If no duration is used, then use the value in the plugin parameters
 *      - Examples:
 *        - $bust(0).clear()
 *        - $bust(2).clear(20)
 * 
 *
 *
 * +++++++++++
 * Expressions
 * +++++++++++
 *
 * If you have set up a bust to use expressions, you can use this text code to
 * change the expression of the bust. Please refer to the "Expression List"
 * part of the help section up above to learn how to set up busts to make an
 * expression sheet.
 * 
 * Text Codes:
 *      \bustExp[id, expression]
 *      \bustExpression[id, expression]
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - Replace expression with either a number index or the string that is
 *        associated with that expression to display the wanted expression.
 *      - Examples:
 *        - \bustExp[0, 1]
 *        - \bustExpression[2, Angry]
 *
 * Script Call:
 *      $bust(id).setExpression(expression)
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - Replace expression with either a number index or the string that is
 *        associated with that expression to display the wanted expression.
 *      - Examples:
 *        - $bust(0).setExpression(1)
 *        - $bust(2).setExpression('Angry')
 * 
 *
 *
 * +++++++++++++++++
 * Battle Animations
 * +++++++++++++++++
 *
 * You can play battle animations on the busts to depict actions, emotions,
 * whatever you want them to do. These will play the battle animation only once
 * before closing out.
 * 
 * Text Codes:
 *      \bustAni[id, ani, mirror, delay]
 *      \bustAnimation[id, ani, mirror, delay]
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - Replace ani with the ID of the battle animation
 *        - Alternatively, you can type out the battle animation's name, too.
 *      - (Optional) Replace mirror with true/face to mirror the animation.
 *      - (Optional) Replace delay with the frames to wait before playing.
 *      - Examples:
 *        - \bustAni[0, 5]
 *        - \bustAnimation[2, Healing One 2, true, 20]
 *
 * Script Call:
 *      $bust(id).startAnimation(ani, mirror, delay)
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - Replace ani with the ID of the battle animation
 *        - Alternatively, you can type out the battle animation's name, too.
 *          If you do, make it into a string for the Script Call.
 *      - (Optional) Replace mirror with true/face to mirror the animation.
 *      - (Optional) Replace delay with the frames to wait before playing.
 *      - Examples:
 *        - $bust(0).startAnimation(5)
 *        - $bust(2).startAnimation('Healing One 2', true, 20)
 *
 *
 *
 * +++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 * Repeating Battle Animations
 * +++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 * 
 * Play battle animations repeatedly instead of one time. Otherwise, this is
 * the same as playing regular battle animations. Repeating animations will
 * stop automatically for message busts when the window closes. For screen
 * busts, they will vanish once the event terminates.
 * 
 * Text Codes:
 *      \bustRepAni[id, ani, mirror, delay]
 *      \bustRepeatAnimation[id, ani, mirror, delay]
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - Replace ani with the ID of the battle animation
 *        - Alternatively, you can type out the battle animation's name, too.
 *      - (Optional) Replace mirror with true/face to mirror the animation.
 *      - (Optional) Replace delay with the frames to wait before playing.
 *      - Examples:
 *        - \bustRepAni[0, 5]
 *        - \bustRepeatingAnimation[2, Healing One 2, true, 20]
 *
 * Script Call:
 *      $bust(id).setupRepeatingAnimation(ani, mirror, delay)
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - Replace ani with the ID of the battle animation
 *        - Alternatively, you can type out the battle animation's name, too.
 *          If you do, make it into a string for the Script Call.
 *      - (Optional) Replace mirror with true/face to mirror the animation.
 *      - (Optional) Replace delay with the frames to wait before playing.
 *      - Examples:
 *        - $bust(0).setupRepeatingAnimation(5)
 *        - $bust(2).setupRepeatingAnimation('Healing One 2', true, 20)
 *
 *
 *

 * Clear Repeating Battle Animation
 * ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 * 
 * Put an end to a repeating battle animation because otherwise that is going
 * to go on forever until the currently running event fully terminates.

 * Move Home
 * +++++++++
 * 
 * Returns a bust sprite back to the home position. For those moments you're
 * too confused, lazy, or both to figure out how to bring a bust sprite back to
 * the original coordinates it was in. This does not work for message busts as

 * Slide In, Slide Out
 * +++++++++++++++++++
 * 
 * Sliding In and Sliding Out is a small move and fade in/out combo that is
 * based around the bust's home position. This makes busts look like they're
 * fading into the scene or fading out of them.
 *
 * Text Code:
 *      \bustSlideIn[id, duration]
 *      \bustSlideInFromLeft[id, duration]
 *      \bustSlideInFromRight[id, duration]
 *      \bustSlideOut[id, duration]

 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - Use the FromLeft, FromRight, ToLeft, ToRight versions to control the
 *        direction the busts are going or leave it up to the plugin.
 *      - (Optional) Replace duration with how long it takes to slide in/out.
 *        - If no duration is used, then use the value in the plugin parameters
 *      - Examples:
 *        - \bustSlideIn[0]
 *        - \bustSlideOut[9, 20]
 *
 * Script Call:
 *      $bust(id).slideIn(duration)
 *      $bust(id).slideInFromLeft(duration)
 *      $bust(id).slideInFromRight(duration)
 *      $bust(id).slideOut(duration)
 *      $bust(id).slideOutToLeft(duration)
 *      $bust(id).slideOutToRight(duration)
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.

 * Mirror, Unmirror, MirrorToggle
 * ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 * 
 * Lets you set the bust sprite to mirror, unmirror, or toggle the mirror
 * setting it currently has.
 *
 * Text Code:
 *      \bustMirror[id]
 *      \bustUnmirror[id]
 *      \bustMirrorToggle[id]
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - Examples:
 *        - \bustMirror[0]
 *        - \bustUnmirror[1]
 *        - \bustMirrorToggle[1]
 *
 * Script Call:

 *      $bust(id).mirrorToggle()
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.

 *        - $bust(9).slideOut(100, 20)
 *
 *
 *
 * ++++++++
 * Scale To
 * ++++++++
 * 
 * This lets you change the scale of the bust sprite to an exact amount. Now, I
 * know that sprites with a negative value for scale flip over, but these text
 * codes and script calls will disable that. If you want to mirror something,
 * use the mirror text codes for it.
 *
 * Text Code:
 *      \bustScaleTo[id, scale, duration]
 *      \bustScaleToX[id, scale, duration]
 *      \bustScaleToY[id, scale, duration]
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - Replace scale with a number value on how to scale it.
 *        - 0.5 is 50%. 1.0 is 100%. 1.5 is 150%.
 *      - (Optional) Replace duration with how long it takes to scale.
 *        - If no duration is used, then use the value in the plugin parameters
 *      - Use the X and Y variations if you want to adjust those specifically
 *      - Examples:
 *        - \bustScaleTo[0, 1.0]
 *        - \bustScaleToX[2, 0.5, 20]
 *        - \bustScaleToY[4, 2.5, 60]
 *
 * Script Call:
 *      $bust(id).scaleTo(scale, duration)
 *      $bust(id).scaleToX(scale, duration)

 *        - $bust(2).scaleToX(0.5, 20)
 *        - $bust(4).scaleToX(2.5, 60)
 *
 *
 *
 * ++++++++
 * Scale By
 * ++++++++
 * 
 * This lets you change the scale of the bust sprite relative to its current
 * scale value. This will work with an absolute value of the current scale to
 * remove any confusion about how mirrored scaling works, so just treat a bust
 * that is mirrored the same way you'd treat a bust that's not mirrored.
 *
 * Text Code:
 *      \bustScaleBy[id, +scale, duration]
 *      \bustScaleByX[id, -scale, duration]
 *      \bustScaleByY[id, +scale, duration]
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.

 * ++++
 * Tone
 * ++++
 * 
 * Give busts a tone! Tones will tint the colors on a bust. The bust will then
 * change its tint towards that tone over time.
 *
 * Text Code:
 *      \bustTone[id, red, green, blue, gray, duration]
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - Replace red with a number between -255 and 255.
 *      - Replace green with a number between -255 and 255.
 *      - Replace blue with a number between -255 and 255.
 *      - Replace gray with a number between 0 and 255.
 *      - (Optional) Replace duration with how long it takes to change tone.
 *        - If no duration is used, then use the value in the plugin parameters
 *      - Examples:
 *        - \bustTone[0, -68, -68, 0, 68]
 *        - \bustTone[5, -68, -68, -68, 0, 60]
 *
 * Script Call:
 *      $bust(id).setTone(red, green, blue, gray, duration)

 *      - Replace gray with a number between 0 and 255.
 *      - (Optional) Replace duration with how long it takes to change tone.
 *        - If no duration is used, then use the value in the plugin parameters
 *      - Examples:
 *        - $bust(0).setTone(-68, -68, 0, 68)
 *        - $bust(5).setTone(-68, -68, -68, 0, 60)
 *

 * ++++++++++
 * Dim, Light
 * ++++++++++
 * 
 * Dim and Light are preset tones that are primarily used for tinting busts.
 * Usually visual novels will dim busts that aren't talking and light the busts
 * that are. This is to speed up the process so that you don't have to type out
 * a tone code every time. You can set the dim and light values in the plugin
 * parameters. They'll also use the duration for tones if no duration is used
 * to specify that specific dim or light tone change.
 *
 * Text Code:
 *      \bustDim[id, duration]
 *      \bustLight[id, duration]
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - (Optional) Replace duration with how long it takes to change tone.
 *        - If no duration is used, then use the value in the plugin parameters
 *      - Examples:
 *        - \bustDim[0]
 *        - \bustLight[5, 60]
 *
 * Script Call:
 *      $bust(id).dim(duration)
 *      $bust(id).light(duration)
 *      - Replace id with the bust ID you want to affect.
 *        - 0 if you want to affect the message bust.
 *        - 1 through 10 if you want to affect the screen busts.
 *      - (Optional) Replace duration with how long it takes to change tone.
 *        - If no duration is used, then use the value in the plugin parameters
 *      - Examples:
 *        - $bust(0).dim()
 *        - $bust(5).light(60)

 * *** Mass Bust Script Calls ***
 *
 * To have multiple busts do a bunch of things at once, you can use this piece
 * of code in a script to accomplish it with whatever script call listed above.
 *
 *
 *
 * [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].forEach(function(i) {
 *   $bust(i).slideIn(20);
 *   $bust(i).moveType('OutBounce');
 *   $bust(i).scaleTo(1.25, 20);
 * });
 *
 * 
 *
 * Replace the numbers in the array with the bust ID's that you want it to
 * affect and whatever script calls in the middle after the $bust(i). Do not
 * replace the i because that tells the code which bust to affect.
 * 
 * Any number that's not listed in that array won't have the bust associated
 * with it performing any of the listed actions in the middle.
 *
